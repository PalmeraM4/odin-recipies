    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baked potatoes are a simple, hearty dish with a crispy skin and fluffy interior.<br>
        They can be served plain, with butter and salt, or topped with cheese, sour cream, and chives.<br>
        Perfect as a side dish or a comforting meal on their own.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Potatoes</b>: Russet potatoes are best for baking due to their starchy texture.</li>
            <li><b>Olive oil</b>: Coats the skin, helping it become crispy during baking.</li>
            <li><b>Salt</b>: Enhances flavor and crisps the skin.</li>
            <li><b>Butter</b>: Adds richness when served.</li>
            <li><b>Sour cream</b>: Creamy topping that complements the fluffy potato.</li>
            <li><b>Cheese</b>: Shredded cheddar or other melty cheeses add flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Chives or green onions</b>: Fresh garnish for color and mild onion flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Bacon bits</b>: Optional, for a smoky, savory topping.</li>
